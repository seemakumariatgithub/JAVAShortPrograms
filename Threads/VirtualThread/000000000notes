🎯 11. One-Line Definition:

              A virtual thread is a lightweight, JVM-managed thread
              that makes blocking operations cheap and lets Java scale to millions of concurrent tasks 
                without changing the traditional thread-based programming model.


==========================================

There are 3 ways to create virtual threads:

    1. Thread.startVirtualThread( () -> {})
    2. Thread.ofVirtual().start( ()->{} )
    3. try( var executor= Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor() ) {
                executor.submit( () -> work() );
        }


==========================================
✅ 8. Example: Handling 1 million tasks
try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) {
        executor.submit(() -> {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            return null;
        });
    }
}


This is completely impossible using platform threads.

============================================
✅ 9. How It Helps in Spring Boot
            - Spring Boot 3.2+ supports virtual threads.

          Configuration:
          
            @Bean
            public Executor taskExecutor() {
                return Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
            }

        - Your REST APIs automatically become highly scalable.

===========================================
✅ Where is a Virtual Thread stored?
    1️⃣ The virtual thread object itself
    
    ✔ Stored in the Java Heap
        (because it's a normal java.lang.Thread object)
     Just like any other Java object.

===========================================
2️⃣ What about the stack?
      For platform threads:
            They have a fixed-size stack (typically 1–2 MB)
            Allocated in native memory (not heap)

    For virtual threads:
        They do NOT have a fixed native stack
        Instead, their stack is continuation-based, stored as:
        Small chunks ("stack frames") in the Java Heap
        Grown and shrunk dynamically
        Garbage-collected like normal objects

  Therefore:
    ✔ Virtual thread stack resides in the heap as objects
    ❌ Not in the native stack of OS threads
    ❌ Not pre-allocated 1–2 MB
