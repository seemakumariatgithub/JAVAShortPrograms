There are two main packages for IO in java :
  1. io 
  2. applet

  1. io  : - This supports java's basic input and output system, like file IO, 
  2. applet : - This supports applets

====================================================
Streams:
    Java perfomrs the IO through STREAMS.
    A Stream in java is an abstract that either produces or consumes information.
    A stream is linked to physical devices by java I/O system.
    All streams behave same even though the actual devices they are connect is different.
          Hence same I/O classes and methods in java can be applied to different devices.
  An input stream can abstract many different kinds of input from, disk, file , keyboard, network connectons.
  An output stream can refer to console, disk file,or ,network connections.

  Streams are cleaner way to deal with input and output without having everypart of program t understand the difference between a keyboard and network. 

     Java implements streams within class hierarchies defined in the
java.io package.
