🔥 Core DSA Problem Patterns for FAANG / MAANG
========================================================
     
🧠 Master Strategy for FAANG
    ✅ 1. Identify the pattern first
            “Is this sliding window or hashing?”
    
    ✅ 2. Recall template
              Every pattern has 2–3 templates only.
    
    ✅ 3. Practice pattern-wise
              Avoid random problem solving.

📌 Recommended Practice Order
          1. Arrays & Strings
          2. Hashing
          3. Two pointers
          4. Sliding window
          5. Stack
          6. Binary search
          7. Trees
          8. Graphs
          9. Dynamic Programming
