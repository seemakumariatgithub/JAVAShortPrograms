    Java implements string as objects of type 'String'.
    Implementing strings as objects allows Java to full provide full complement of features that make string handling convenient.
    as string object can be constructed in various ways, makes it easy to obtain string whenever is needed.

    Now:
    In java the string object that we create, once created cannot be changed.
        Means the string object that is being created, the characters that it comprise of cannot be changed.
    So whenever we try to change the content as new string object gets created with the modifed characters.
    The original string remains unchanged.

    This approach is used, because the fixed, immutable string can be implemented more efficiently.

    For the cases where we need modifyable strings we have 'StringBuffer' and 'StringBuilder'.
