Intoduction:

    JDK8, added Lambda Expressions, that significantly ehance Java , beacuse of the tw reasons:
      1. This added new syntax, that increased the expressive power of languge.
          This streamline the way some common constructs ar implemented.
      2. Addition of this added new capacbilities being incorporated into the API Library.
          Among these capability one is Paralle processing to take advantage of multicore processor,
          and second is new 'stream' API, which supposrt pipeline operation on data.
      3. THis expression also acted as catalyst for some features like:
              default method in interface
              method referencing

==================================================================
There are two important contructs here:

1. Lambda Expression
2. Functional Interface
