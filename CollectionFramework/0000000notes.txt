java.util PACKAGE:
===============================================================================================
This is versy powerful package, that contains large assortment of classes and interfaces,
That support a broad range of functionality.
For Example:
    To name few: classes that can :
        1. generate pseudorandom number
        2. manage date and time
        3. observve events
        4. manipulate sets of bits
        5. tokenize strings
        6. handle formatted data

java.util package also containes one ot the Java's most powerful subsystems: 
    The COLLECTIONS Framewwork.

COLLECTIONS FRAMEWORK:
    The collections framework is a sophisticated hierarchy of interfaces and classes,
          that provide state-of-the-art technology for managing groups of objects.
    This framework has standardized the way in which group of objects can be handled by a programs.
    This framework was added in JDK1.2
    Prior to this java provided ad hoc classes, 'Dictionary','Vector','Stack, 'Properties', to store 
            and manipulate the group of objects.


GOAL for defining COLLETIONS FRAMEWORK:
    1. To be highly efficient and provide high performance
    2. To allow different types of collections to work in simillar manner.
            To have high degree of interoperability.
    3. Extending and adapting a collections whould be easy.
    4. Algorithm is also an important part of Collection Farmaework.
            These are defined as static method within the Collections class.
                Hence they are available to all collections.
            This Alogorithms have provided a standard way to manipulate the data in collections.
            Algorithms here operate on collections.
    5. Iterator interface:
        An iterator have defined a generalized and standard way for accessing the elements in the collections
                one at a time.
        An iterator provides the means of enumerating the content of collection.
        Each collection have provided iterator, 
            hence elements of any colections can be accessed through the methods provided by Iterator.

We can also implement our own collection.
Various special purpose implementations are created for convineince of use,
And along with it some partial implementationss are provded that make creating our own collection class easier.
And a mechanism were added, in Collections Framwork that allow the integration of standard arrays into the Colletions Framework


    6. In addition to collections, Collections Framework has also defined seeral map Interfaces and classes.
            Although maps are part of Collections Framework, thy are not 'collections'.

====================================================================================================
JDK5 has changed the Collections Framework:

    Some fundamental changes were done are, addition of:
        1. generics
        2. Autoboxing/unboxing
        3. for-each style of 'for' loop.

        1. generics:
                Generic has fundamentaly changed the collections framework.
                All Collections are now generic.

                Genercis added the 'type Safety' feature to collections.
                Proir to generics, all collections stored Objects references, 
                    which meant that any collection could store any type of object.
                Doing this resulted in run-time type mismatch errors, when type mismatch occured.
                Now with generic, it s possible to explicitly state the type of data being stored, 
                    and thus run-time type mismatch erros can be avoided.



        2. Autoboxing/unboxing
        3. for-each style of 'for' loop.
