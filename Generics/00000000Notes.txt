Generics Introduction:
========================================================================

Introducted in JDK 5.
This made creation of classes, method and interfaces in which type of data upon which they operate is specfied as a parameter.
The term 'generic' here means, 'parameterized types'. 
The class or method that operates on parameterized type is calledd 'generic' as in 'generic class' or 'generic method'.

Generic added type safety.
Now it is no longer necessary to explicitly employ cast.
with generic all casts are automatic and implicit.
